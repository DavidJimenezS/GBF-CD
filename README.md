# GBF-CD
Graph based fusion for change detection

Here you will find all the code used to generate a change map in eleven cases of study.

gbf_cd.m is the main code that generates the changes map.
cohensKappa.m will generate all the results showed in the paper and also the change map with respec to FA, MA, P, R, K, OE.
